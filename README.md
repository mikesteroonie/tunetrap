# TuneTrap Stack üöÄ

This social media app I'm creating built on the angle to allow people to create a profile around their music tastes built with React Native. The stack is: Typescript, Expo Router, Tailwind(Nativewind), Zustand, and Supabase(PostGreSQL) for the backend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- [Expo Router](https://github.com/expo/router): The File-based router for universal React Native apps.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/): NativeWind uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native.

- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction): A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution.

### ‚ùì What & Why

This was an app I decided to create because I felt there was an untapped potential in the music documentation aspect of social media. Lots of people on the now most-popular app TikTok express how a certain song "brings them back" or how they have superior music taste than one another. A few even link their spotify playlist in their bio, but this is a little unintuitive.

TuneTrap allows users to create timelines of their music tastes in answer to prompts such as "My Relationship with [ARTIST_NAME]", or "My Late Night Drive Song", and see how it evolves over time.

Furthermore posts are only quoted song lyrics, allowing the song to communicate their sentiment for them. The goal here is to be the next interactive social media, and find pockets of opportunity such as being the go to link to put in one's Instagram bio.

All designs were created in Figma by me, and all artists artwork are being utilized in alignment with Spotifies legal documenation ‚ò∫Ô∏è
